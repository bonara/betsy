I wanted to go with a mobile first approach, but it actually lead to more verbose CSS in this case, so I've gone web first. Can't always force things...

Side note: I know that this style of nesting in SASS doesn't result in the most performance efficient CSS code... but on the OCD/organizational side, I like it. So for CodePen purposes, CSS selector performance be damned.
